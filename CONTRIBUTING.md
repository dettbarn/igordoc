# CONTRIBUTING

In principle anyone can contribute to this.
Here are some features that would be nice to have:

*  Generate documentations in other formats, e.g. html, pdf
*  Allow for procedure files in a different style
*  Possibility to call directly from within Igor Pro
*  Allow user to supplement the automatic documentation with additional text
